DaaS : Database as a Service.. 

--> Amazon Aurora (MySql Compatable / PostGreSQL Compatable)
--> Mysql		: Mysql Workbench
--> Oracle		: Toad
--> MariaDB		: Workbench
--> PostgreSQL		: PGAdmin
--> Microsoft SQL	: SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)

--> As DB contains lot of Sensitive information, we run RDS instances always in Private Subnet.


License:
--> LI (License Included)
--> BYOL (bring your own license)

Backup: Snapshots: 

--> Automatic SS : We cannot delete these SS. By reduscing Backup Retention period we can keep only limited Automated SS. When we delete RDS instance, this deletes automatically.
	--> We will get point-in-time  recovery option.

--> Manual SS : Manually we need to create. We need to delete manully.
