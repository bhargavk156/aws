Block Based Storage : Install and run the application / OS.. : Instance Store, EBS
Network Based Storage : Storage over the network.. : EFS, FSx

S3 : Simple Storage Service

--> We store all the data in buckets.
--> Bucket name should be unique.
--> Soft limit for bucket count : 100

Bucket Naming Limitations: 

Min : 3 Char, 63 Char
Should not start with Capital letters.
Should not start with . / end with . / no ..
Bucket name should not resemble IP address format.


Off : Block all public access... AT bucket level.. 


Standard Path: 
https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

Virtual Path: 
https://bucketname.s3.region.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname

--> No Pre-provisioning required.
--> Based on selected storage class, and data transfering, we'll get charged.
--> We have unlimited storage in s3 platform.
--> We have a limit for Object size.. 
--> Max object size s3 supports is 5 TB..

Versioning :
--> We can track all changes happening on our file.

Version : HIDE
--> We can get file back if we delete accidentally. 
--> We will get a Delete marker, Delete the DM, we can get file back.

Version : SHOW.
--> If we delete anything, it won' give us the Delete Marker.


LCR : Transit object from one storage class to another storage class using LCR. At some point of time, we can trigger to delete the latest version object / Previous verion object.


CRR / SRR : 
___________

Cross Region Replication
Same region replciation

Server access logging : Want to enable logging on a single bucket. 


Static website hosting : 
--> Easy to Manage
--> For our website also we'll get 99.99% avail, 99.999999999% durability
--> No OS Patches/ No OS level operations required.

--> We should give atleast readOnly permissions for everyone.
--> Bucket Name should be same as Domain Name.

http://bucketname.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com	--> avinash.website

http status codes:

2XX : OK / SUCCESS
3XX : Redirection error
4XX : Client Side error
5XX : Service side error


Encryptions : 

--> In-Transite Encryption
	--> SSL / TLS enabled

--> Server Side Encryption / At-Rest Encryption
	
--> SSE - S3 (S3 manages the Pubic and private Keys) : Who have valid permissions on s3 platform can decrypt the data.

--> SSE - KMS (KMS Manages the Public and Private Keys, Key material also generates by KMS only) :  

	--> AWS Managed keys : aws/s3 : Who have valid permissions on s3 platform can 					decrypt the data.
	--> Customer Managed Key : We need to define, who can administrate the key 
					We can define who can use the key.
	(NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY For CUstomer Managed KEY).

--> SSE - C (KMS Manages the Public and Private Keys but Customer need to upload the key material (public key and private key))


--> Client Side Encryption : Before uploading data to s3 platform, in our local devices/ environment we can encrypt the data with our own encry mechanism.



Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations

Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations

Object Lock : 
--> We cannot enable Object lock to an existing bucket.
--> If we required we can raise a ticket with AWS, they'll enable.
--> Versioning must be enable, if we want to use Object lock.

--> While creating bucket, we need enable this option.

Governance mode can be disabled by AWS accounts that have specific IAM permissions.
Compliance mode cannot be disabled by any user, including the root account.

Tags : We can add tags for easy management.

Transfer acceleration : For qyuick uplaod / downloads via Edge Locations. 

Events : 
--> SQS Simple Queue Service
--> Lambda
--> SNS Simple Notification Service  : 


Requester pays: Instead of Bucket owner, who is requesting the data, he'll get charged for the request and data transfer.

Storage class analysis: Tells about our object access patterns, Suggests best storage class for our data.

Metrics : Graphs about our s3 bucket.  : Cloudwatch gives us all these metrics.
